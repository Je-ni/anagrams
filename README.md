# anagrams
Code on my anagram game(checks if two words are anagrams) built during Genesys Internship using pure javascript

# usage
It's really simple..comment out every other function apart from the anagram function because the file contains more than just anagram code.
then invoke the anagram function checkIfAnagram(word1, word2)..
input the two words you want to compare as word1 and word2.
